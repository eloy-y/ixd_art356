# Project 1: Interactive Randomizer - Smoothie Rush

### Project Background
This project is meant to create a randomizer experience for the user. My initial thought was to create a more fun game experience rather than just an interactive one. This led me to an idea of a reaction game where objects would appear in random locations and the user has to find the specified object within a short amount of time. 

To develop this, I started by using text emojis first to get the function and mechanics started. Transitioning to images was tricky at first because it wasn't the same code to make it work. To fix it, I had to create an extra string of arrays that matches the variable and image. Basically, I had an array filled with all the image files and another array for the variable name for each image.

After getting the main mechanic and purpose of the game, I thought it was fun, but I think it lacked the randomizer experience that the project is asking for. To cater more to that experience, I decided to create win screens that are different each time you win. This one was fairly simple, as it's basically just exercise1, although creating the assets was time consuming. 

Lastly, I wanted to add more extra stuff to polish the game. My first thought was a start screen. When creating the start screen, I had the idea of creating an endless mode for people who wanted to keep going with the game instead of getting a win screen, so I added that. Then I remembered that I should add sound, and also added that, and finished my first published version of this game.

I'm very happy with how the game turned out. Things I want to add in the future, potentially, would be a better "Game Over Screen" as well as a ramped-up difficulty for Endless Mode.

### Norman Doors // Discoverability and Understanding

I thought the idea of "Norman Doors" was interesting. I understand that with some doors, you won't be able to tell how to use them just by looking at them, but I personally have never had a problem with it. If I pull on a door but you're supposed to push it, I just do that and move on with my day. However, the idea of design is apparent, and for most things, it should be easy to identify how to use something to achieve a better user experience. 

I really like the discoverability and understanding concept. Something that made me think about was remotes. Older remotes have many buttons which has easy discoverability, but hard understanding because we didn't know what each of the buttons did. The newer remotes  have harder discoverability with things like the touch surfaces that doesn't really indicate that you need to use that to maneuver through the screen. Although it does have a better understanding with very few buttons, that are easy to tell what you do with them. (Page 3)

### Design and Human-Machine Interaction

I thought this was a fundamental concept to grasp. It's very easy to understand, but it's the application and the design process itself that feels challenging. I really like human-centered design. I particularly like the section where Don Norman highlighted that it's easy to create something that works harmoniously between human and machine when things are going right, but the hard and important part is to create something that can operate smoothly between human and machine when things go wrong. (Page 8-9)

### Fundamental Principles of Design

#### Affordances

I thought this was pretty straightforward. Affordances are properties an object has that it could provide to whatever/whoever it is interacting with. I do believe affordances are important to be discoverable, as Norman said. Some things should be perceived easily, and a person knows what it afford.

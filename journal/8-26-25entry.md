### Norman Doors // Discoverability and Understanding

I thought the idea of "Norman Doors" was interesting. I understand that with some doors, you won't be able to tell how to use them just by looking at them, but I personally have never had a problem with it. If I pull on a door but you're supposed to push it, I just do that and move on with my day. However, the idea of design is apparent, and for most things, it should be easy to identify how to use something to achieve a better user experience. 

I really like the discoverability and understanding concept.

### Norman Doors // Discoverability and Understanding

I thought the idea of "Norman Doors" was interesting. I understand that with some doors, you won't be able to tell how to use them just by looking at them, but I personally have never had a problem with it. If I pull on a door but you're supposed to push it, I just do that and move on with my day. However, the idea of design is apparent, and for most things, it should be easy to identify how to use something to achieve a better user experience. 

I really like the discoverability and understanding concept. Something that made me think about was remotes. Older remotes have many buttons which has easy discoverability, but hard understanding because we didn't know what each of the buttons did. The newer remotes  have harder discoverability with things like the touch surfaces that doesn't really indicate that you need to use that to maneuver through the screen. Although it does have a better understanding with very few buttons, that are easy to tell what you do with them. (Page 3)

### Design and Human-Machine Interaction

I thought this was a fundamental concept to grasp. It's very easy to understand, but it's the application and the design process itself that feels challenging. I really like human-centered design. I particularly like the section where Don Norman highlighted that it's easy to create something that works harmoniously between human and machine when things are going right, but the hard and important part is to create something that can operate smoothly between human and machine when things go wrong. (Page 8-9)

### Fundamental Principles of Design

#### Affordances and Signifiers

I thought this was pretty straightforward. Affordances are relationships an object has that it could provide to whatever/whoever it is interacting with. I do believe affordances are important to be discoverable, as Norman said. Some things should be perceived easily, and a person knows what it afford.

Signifiers are also straightforward with the name. It signals to the user how it should be interacted with and what its affordances are. I like how Don Norman created this word to differentiate it from affordances because they can easily be interchangeable. 

#### Mapping and Feedback

Mapping is also self-explanatory. Good mapping is self-explanatory buttons or buttons that make sense to the user. For example, most controllers jump action is the bottom button on the right-hand side (different symbols for different controllers). Some games, specifically fighting games, don't do that, which makes it harder for me to adjust.

I found feedback the trickiest to manage so far. I did think that feedback are very important for users to know that something is working. But the way Don Norman talked about it made it more complicated to deal with. There are many intricacies to why feedback is not helpful. The fact that Norman said that "poor feedback can be worse than no feedback" is quite daunting. It made me think that you can't just attach feedback to things to make it feel more complete. You actually need to carefully think and plan it so that the user is satisfied instead of irritated. (Page 24)

#### Conceptual Model and System Image

I thought this section was hard to grasp at first, but it became much clearer with the scissor analogy as well as the fridge analogy. To me, it's basically everything else previously working together as a model. To have a good conceptual model, you need to have affordances with clear signifiers to instruct the user on what to do and what it does. It also needs good mapping to help understand the results of buttons and good and immediate feedback in order to see said results. Relating to, the system image is what the user's initial perception of the product with the information they have, from my understanding. 

### Paradox of Technology and Design Challenge

I think the paradox of technology is something that everyone is somewhat aware of. All technologies provide something to make things more efficient, but is it really efficient if it's not easily learned by others? I do believe that as the world progresses, these technologies will become second nature and easily learned by future generations.

Designing is definitely a hard challenge with different teams working on a product and satisfying all the needs in order to sell well. I really felt when Don Norman wished that buyers and consumers could see things from the designer's perspective, and how difficult it is to address all underlying problems to create the best experience.

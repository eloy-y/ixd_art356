### Norman Doors // Discoverability and Understanding

I thought the idea of "Norman Doors" was interesting. I understand that with some doors, you won't be able to tell how to use them just by looking at them, but I personally have never had a problem with it. If I pull on a door but you're supposed to push it, I just do that and move on with my day. However, the idea of design is apparent, and for most things, it should be easy to identify how to use something to achieve a better user experience. 

I really like the discoverability and understanding concept. Something that made me think about was remotes. Older remotes have many buttons which has easy discoverability, but hard understanding because we didn't know what each of the buttons did. The newer remotes  have harder discoverability with things like the touch surfaces that doesn't really indicate that you need to use that to maneuver through the screen. Although it does have a better understanding with very few buttons, that are easy to tell what you do with them. (Page 3)

# Chapter 2 of DOET

### The Gulf of Execution and Evaluation

Whenever a user uses a design, there's always a gap between the user's goal and the system's execution. As designers, we need to study this gap and learn the mistakes and strengths.

The execution is moreso the gap between what the user wants and what's actually possible
The evaluation is moreso the gap between what the system does and how the user understands/interprets it

### Learned and Taught Helplessness

Learned helplessness is when a user repeatedly fails to execute the system
Taught helplessness is when the system teachers you to be helpless

### 7 Stages of Action
1. Forming the Goal
2. Forming the Intention
3. Specifying an Action
4. Executing the Action
5. Perceiving the State of the World
6. Interpreting the State
7. Evaluating the Outcome

Discoverability, Feedback, Conceptual Model, Affordances, Signifiers, Mappings, Constraints

### Three Levels of Processing
1. Visceral - Appearance
2. Behavioral - Functionality
3. Reflectional - Meaning and Connection
